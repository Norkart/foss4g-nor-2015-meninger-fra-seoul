#My observations at FOSS4G in Seoul

 - The venue has a lot to say for who shows up! A lot more Asians this year (duh), a lot fewer
  Yanks. The number of Europeans seemed rather stable. Bonn will be interesting!
 - If last year was The Year of Javascript, then this year was The Old School Strikes Back!
   - More seriously, Javascript has taken its place as one of many useful languages for FOSS4G,
   but is not The One Language to rule them all like last year's may have given the impression of.
   - Not as many presentations in pure JS, could be because of fewer Yankee hipsters.
 - Another pushback against last years trend was in projections. The "WGS84 All the things" banner
 that was raised high last year was challenged by a number of talks on using proper porjections.
  - Andrea Aime did a good talk on Geoserver's advanced support for projections
  - From Canada came Polarmap.js, a Leaflet plugin for polar projections, pretty relevant for Norwegian interests as well!
   - It's from a larger Artic Web Map project, which creates OSM tiles in suitable projections for the Arctic.
 - Discussion around OSM companions with freer licensing
  - This is because the ODBL in OSM seems scaryily copyleft for a lot of businesses, especially Mapbox.
  - OpenAdresses.io has many times more address points than OSM now
   - All of Norway is there
 - A lot of stuff regarding Point Clouds:
  - PDAL (Like GDAL but for point clouds) is in 1.0 and quite impressive
  - Point clouds have been shown in the browser.
  - Our very own Ivan did Point Cloud: The Musical with a very valuable lesson on avoiding format
 - OpenDroneMap allows you to fly about with a cheap drone and create point clouds, orthos, DEMs
 - Related to OpenDroneMap is OpenAerialMap, which accepts orthos and satellites from many sources,
 from amateurs with ODM to opened government data sets.
  lockin in this brave new world.
 - Cesium got a lot of attention
  - Guides on how to migrate away from Google Earth
  - Showcases on what it can do:
   - Buildings in 3D
   - Seamless integration with OpenLayers 3
 - The geoPackage standard is ready
  - Like Mbtiles, shapefiles and services all rolled into one downloadable file!
  - Being pushed by the US Army Corp of Engineers
 - IoT sensors were mentioned a lot, now that the OGC has a standard in place
 - Looks like WPS has finally gained some traction, there are actually people using it for things now.
  - Support improving in multiple projects
  - FFI made some interesting stuff
 - Using Machine Learning to improve OSM POIs
  - I think we're getting to the point where Machine Learning can do a lot of good stuff in geo.
 - Next year it's in Bonn
  - Pretty cheap and easy to get to, so everyone should go!
  - Students should join geoforum and get a travel grant
